I am a PhD student at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) with my research focusing on natural language processing and computational linguistics. I am a member of [UBC Deep Learning and NLP Lab](https://www.dlnlp.ai/) and [UBC NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/). Before joining UBC, I was a machine learning engineer at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html), developing machine learning systems which were deployed worldwide. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taipei, Taiwan.
