Hi!

I am a PhD student in Linguistics at University of British Columbia (UBC) with my research focusing on machine translation, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. My ultimate goal is having computer to learn, understand and produce languages by incorporating both computational and linguistic methods. Currently, I aim at improving the machine translation performance for low-resource langauges with transfer learning methods.
