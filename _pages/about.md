I am a PhD student at the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) with my research focusing on machine translation, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. My ultimate goal is having computer to learn, understand and produce languages by incorporating both computational and linguistic methods. Currently, I aim at improving the machine translation performance for low-resource langauges with transfer learning methods. I am a member of UBC Deep Learning and NLP Lab. Before joining UBC, I was a machine learning engineer at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html), developing anomaly detection systems deployed worldwide. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taipei, Taiwan.
